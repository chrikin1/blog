## Description

> This is a web application that allows various users to submit a short pitch. Users can also be able to view other pitches from different categories (Pick-up Lines, Interview Pitches, Product Pitches, Promotion Pitches), comment and vote. For a user to do any of that, they need to have registered.

## User Stories

As a user I would like:

> * to view the blog posts submitted
> * to comment on blog posts
> * to view the most recent posts
> * to be alerted when a new post is made by joining a subscription.
> * to sign in to the blog.
> * to create a blog from the application.
> * to delete comments that I find insulting or degrading.

## How it works

> * A user can sign up
> * A user can subscribe to receive email notifications
> * A user can also post comments and articles.

## Technologies Used

> * Python3.6
